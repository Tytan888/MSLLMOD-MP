    "Reason: The essential fields 'english_sentence' and 'filipino_sentence' are missing. Therefore, the system must first ask the user to provide these. Additionally, since no additional information or context has been requested, and the acceptability of the weights has not been confirmed, these steps are also necessary.",
    "Next steps: ['ask \"Please provide the English sentence and the Filipino translation.\"', 'ask \"Please provide additional context or instructions for the translation, if any.\"', 'ask \"Are the following weights acceptable: Accuracy is High, Fluency is High, Completeness is Low, and Cultural Appropriateness is Low?\"']",
    "Reason: The system has the necessary English and Filipino sentences. It has also confirmed that the user does not have additional instructions and has accepted the provided weights. Therefore, no further questions are needed to proceed with the translation quality judgment.",

    "Reason: The system has both the English and Filipino sentences. It has also previously asked for additional instructions and confirmation of weights, and the user notes indicate these were addressed. Therefore, the system has enough information to proceed with judgment.",

    "Reason: The provided information includes the English and Filipino sentences and a high similarity score. However, the phrase is incomplete, making it difficult to assess the full translation quality.  Therefore, further steps are needed to understand the context and meaning of the incomplete phrases.",

    "Reason: The system has the English and Filipino sentences. The user notes indicate no additional instructions are needed and the weights are acceptable. Therefore, no further questions are required.",
    "Next steps: []",
    "Reason: The provided tool notes indicate a high similarity score between the English and Filipino sentences. The dictionary lookups for individual Filipino words provide sufficient context. No further tools are needed to make a judgment on the translation quality.",
