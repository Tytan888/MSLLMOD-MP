    "Reason: The essential English and Filipino sentences are missing. The system needs to request these first. After obtaining the sentences, the system will need to ask the user if the provided weights are acceptable, as this question has not been asked yet. Finally, it needs to ask for any additional context or instructions, as this has also not been done.",
    "Next steps: ['ask \"Please provide the English sentence and the Filipino translation.\"', 'ask \"Are the following weights acceptable: Accuracy weight is High, Fluency weight is High, Completeness weight is Low, and Cultural appropriateness weight is Low?\"', 'ask \"Please provide any additional context or instructions for the translation.\"']",
    "Reason: The English and Filipino sentences are present. The system has already asked for additional context and if the weights are acceptable. The user notes indicate 'no more' additional context is needed, so that step is considered complete. The system can now proceed to ask if the provided weights are acceptable.",

    "Reason: The Filipino sentence is a literal translation of the English idiom 'It's raining cats and dogs.' To judge the quality, it's important to understand the meaning of the English idiom and whether the Filipino translation conveys a similar meaning or is a common way to express heavy rain in Filipino. Dictionary lookups for 'pusa' and 'aso' will confirm their literal meanings. Sentence similarity might not be the most effective tool here as it's an idiomatic expression, but a lookup for the idiom's meaning in English might be helpful, although not directly supported by the available tools. However, given the literal translation, we can infer it's likely not a good translation without further information on Filipino idioms for heavy rain.",

    "Reason: The essential fields 'english_sentence' and 'filipino_sentence' are present. The system has already asked for additional instructions and if the weights are acceptable.

    "Reason: The provided Filipino sentence is a literal translation of the English idiom \"It's raining cats and dogs.\" The tool notes provide definitions for 'cats' and 'dogs' in both English and Filipino. However, the core issue is to determine if the literal translation conveys the intended idiomatic meaning in Filipino. To assess this, sentence similarity between the English idiom and its Filipino translation is necessary. While Filipino dictionary lookups for 'pusa' and 'aso' have been provided, they only confirm the literal meaning of the words, not their idiomatic usage in this context. Therefore, a sentence similarity check is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the translation quality.",

    "Reason: The provided information includes the English sentence, its Filipino translation, and the similarity score between them. The tool notes contain definitions for 'cats' and 'dogs' in English, and 'pusa' and 'aso' in Filipino, along with their top results. The similarity score is also provided. This information is sufficient to make a judgment on the translation quality. No further tools are needed.",
